NAME
    String::Urandom - An alternative to using /dev/random

SYNOPSIS
      use String::Urandom;

      my $obj = new String::Urandom;

      # set the string length 
      $obj->str_length(255);

      # set the characters
      $obj->str_chars('a b c 1 2 3');

      # print the result
      print $obj->rand_string, "\n";

DESCRIPTION
    Using output from /dev/urandom. Simply convert bytes into 8-bit
    characters.

METHODS
  str_length
    This method will set/get the string character length.

    The default value is: 32

      $obj->str_length(255);

  str_chars
    This method will set/get characters used when generating a string.

    The default value is: a-z A-Z 0-9

      $obj->str_chars('a e i o u 1 2 3');

  rand_string
    This method generates a new random string.

      $obj->rand_string;

REQUIREMENTS
    Any flavour of UNIX that supports /dev/urandom

NOTES
    The /dev/urandom is an ("unlocked" random source) which reuses the
    internal pool to produce more pseudo-random bits. Since this is the
    case, the read may contain less entropy than its counterpart
    /dev/random. Knowing this, this module was intended to be used as a
    pseudorandom string generator for less secure applications where
    response timing may an issue.
