Install this package from source:

  $ perl MakeFile.PL PREFIX=~/path/to/custom/dir LIB=~/path/to/custom/lib
  $ make
  $ make test
  $ make install


Perl one liner using CPAN.pm:

  perl -MCPAN -e 'install String::Urandom'


Use of CPAN.pm in interactive mode:

  $ perl -MCPAN -e shell

  cpan> install String::Urandom
  cpan> quit

Just like the manual installation of Perl modules, the user may need root access
during this process to insure write permission is allowed within the installation
directory.
